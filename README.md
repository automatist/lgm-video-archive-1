# A website for the LGM video archive

An under-development website for the video archive of the Libre Graphics Meeting conference.

## Documentation & Discussion

Documentation about the principles and architecture of the archive can be found [in the docs folder](docs/README.md). 

Discussion about structure and functionality [is happening here](https://github.com/libregraphicsmeeting/infrastructure/issues/42).

## Technical matters

### WordPress Theme

The theme has it’s own [documentation file](themes/lgmvid/README.md).

### Functionality Plugin

A custom WordPress plugin, for keeping functionality separated from design. It also has it’s own [documentation file](plugins/lgm-video/README.md).
