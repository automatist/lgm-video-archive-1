##Â Theme organisation

### CSS (style sheets)

We use the following CSS directory structure: 

- The file `style.css` at root level is necessary for the WordPress theme to work, but we don't load it.
- We put the css files into `/css/dev/`, where we split them into different files : typography, layout, mediaqueries, print styles...
- Once the site is in an advanced state, we will use a build-script (such as [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)) that compiles them into a single minimized CSS file, in the `/css/build/` directory.

## More Documentation

Documentation about the principles and architecture of the archive can be found [in the project README](../../docs/README.md).
