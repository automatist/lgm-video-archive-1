# Import

Some notes about methods for importing talk data into the archive.

Since the current website runs in WordPress, we import data using the  WordPress eXtended RSS file format (used by native WordPress import / export).

To export such a file from an existing website: in wp-admin, go into Tools > Export.

To import such a file, it is needed to install the [WordPress Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/) plugin.
